# Accounts

Accounts are the central starting point when interacting with the Coti network and using Coti Services. A Coti account is an entity, a distinct object type, stored in the ledger, that holds tokens. Accounts can hold the native Coti token (COTI), custom fungible, and custom non-fungible tokens (NFTs) created on the Coti network.

The Coti native token COTI is a utility token primarily used to pay for transactions and gas fees when interacting with the network.&#x20;

You interact with the network by submitting transactions that modify the ledger's state or submitting query requests that read data from the ledger. Most transactions and queries have a transaction fee that is charged in COTI.
