The COTI SDKs provide access to various example smart contracts that implement functionality of the gcEVM. Click on the desired SDK to view its information:

* [**Python SDK**](https://github.com/coti-io/coti-sdk-python)
* [**Typescript SDK**](https://github.com/coti-io/coti-sdk-typescript)
* [**Hardhat** ](https://github.com/coti-io/confidentiality-contracts?tab=readme-ov-file#hardhat-confidential-contracts---usage)[**Development Environment**](https://github.com/coti-io/confidentiality-contracts?tab=readme-ov-file#hardhat-confidential-contracts---usage)



~~The SDKs also support ECDSA signature schemes, ensuring the integrity and authenticity of transactions. Additionally, we provide seamless integration with the COTI network interface, offering convenient methods for signing, verifying, and preparing input text, along with generating function signatures.~~&#x20;

~~Whether you're encrypting sensitive data, verifying signatures, or interacting with the COTI network interface, these SDKs provide the necessary tools to build robust and secure applications across multiple programming languages. The following examples demonstrate how to use the SDK.~~
