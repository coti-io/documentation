## Native Transfer

The following process will help you deploy the [**`native_transfer.py`**](https://github.com/coti-io/coti-sdk-python-examples/blob/master/examples/basics/native\_transfer.py) example from the [**COTI Python SDK Examples**](https://github.com/coti-io/coti-sdk-python-examples) project. This script will transfer native funds from your wallet account to a random wallet. It will also:

* Create a EOA (Externally Owned Account)
* Validate minimum balance

{% hint style="info" %}
Ensure your environment meets all the pre-requisites. Visit the [pre-requisites section of the readme](https://github.com/coti-io/coti-sdk-python/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#python-sdk-coti-sdk-python---usage). Alternatively, use an editor like [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/) to take care of the pre-requisites for you.
{% endhint %}

1.  Clone the Python examples repo along with its submodules into your desired location

    ```bash
    git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/coti-io/coti-sdk-python-examples.git
    ```


2.  Change directory to the newly create one

    ```bash
    cd coti-sdk-python-examples
    ```


3.  Install the project's requirements

    ```bash
    python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```


4.  Set the python path as following

    ```bash
    export PYTHONPATH=$PWD
    ```


5.  Run the `native_transfer.py` script

    ```bash
    python3 examples/basics/native_transfer.py
    ```

    \
    Running the script will automatically create an account and a key/value pair with name: `ACCOUNT_PRIVATE_KEY` (visible in the `.env` file). The script will output something like this:



    ```bash
    So you dont have an account yet, dont worry... lets create one right now!

    \
    It is normal to receive the exception `Not enough balance!` on the first run. This will be resolved once the account is funded.\

6. Head to the faucet at [**https://faucet.coti.io**](https://faucet.coti.io) to get devnet funds. \
   Send the following message to the BOT using your newly created `account address`:\
   \
   `devnet <account address>`\
   \
   The bot will reply with the message:\
   \

   &#x20;
7.  Run the `native_transfer.py` script once more

    ```bash
    python3 examples/basics/native_transfer.py
    ```

    \
    The script will output as following:

    ```

    \
    Now that your account is created and funded, you can now onboard the account to get your new network key.

## On-board Account

The following process will help you deploy the [**`onboard_account.py`**](https://github.com/coti-io/coti-sdk-python/blob/main/examples/onboard/onboard\_account.py) example from the [**COTI Python SDK Examples**](https://github.com/coti-io/coti-sdk-python-examples) repo. This script onboards an EOA into the network. It will also:

* Trigger the network to create a unique AES key for the user
* Encrypt the unique user-specific AES key using the Public key so that its value can be viewed only by the EOA owner.

This is a mandatory script for any operation executed in any contract requiring encrypt/decrypt operations which are part of the new EVM precompiles actions.

1.  Run the `onboard_account.py` script

    <pre class="language-bash"><code class="lang-bash"><strong>python3 examples/onboard/onboard_account.py
    </strong></code></pre>

    \
    Running the script will automatically create an account and an `ACCOUNT_ENCRYPTION_KEY` (visible in the `.env` file as well as the output). The script output will look something like this:\


    ```bash
    provider:  https://devnet.coti.io

    (True, 'ACCOUNT_ENCRYPTION_KEY', 'fd3d781ddcbd1e1cedd2d75460f30636')
    ```



    {% hint style="info" %}
    This encryption key is **sensitive.** Ensure it is not uploaded to public places and keep it safe. This key is produced per EOA wallet, meaning a unique wallet/EOA combination will have a unique encryption key.
    {% endhint %}

    \
    The `.env` file will also have other useful information, such as the node address, websocket address, and the contract directories.\
    \
    Now that the account is onboarded, let's deploy a contract on-chain.

## Deploy Data On-Chain

The following process will help you deploy the [**`data_on_chain.py`**](https://github.com/coti-io/coti-sdk-python-examples/blob/master/examples/data\_onchain/data\_on\_chain.py) example from the [**COTI Python SDK Examples**](https://github.com/coti-io/coti-sdk-python-examples) repo. As its name suggests, the contract will compile and deploy the corresponding [**`DataOnChain.sol`**](https://github.com/coti-io/confidentiality-contracts/blob/main/contracts/examples/DataOnChain.sol) contract, located in the `confidentiality-contracts` directory.

This contract can be used in order to browse and get a feel of the COTI network. The contract allows for the secure handling of encrypted data, enabling storage, transformation, and arithmetic operations on encrypted values using the [**`MpcCore`**](https://github.com/coti-io/confidentiality-contracts/blob/main/contracts/lib/MpcCore.sol) library. It supports operations where values are encrypted using both network and user keys, ensuring data privacy and security on-chain.

1.  Navigate to the `examples` directory in the `confidentiality-contracts` directory inside the `coti-sdk-python-examples` project.

    ```bash
    cd confidentiality-contracts/contracts/examples
    ```


2.  Run the `data_on_chain.py` script

    ```bash
    python3 ../../examples/data_onchain/data_on_chain.py
    ```

    \
    Running the script will deploy the contract and output the address where the contract was deployed. The script output will look something like this (with some omitted block hashes at the end of ther response):\


    ```bash
    provider:  https://devnet.coti.io/rpc
    chain-id:  13068200
    latest block:  0x75a2f9d10db48fdc53f14d9ce565420e680b06231cd34e3c194f14fbd0c5f999
    account address: 0xB101fbd6938AaE2e472E247e36555528d7ff4A89
    account balance:  4993201875000000000 wei ( 4.993201875  ether)
    account nonce:  2
    Compiling DataOnChain...
    Deploying DataOnChain...
    Contract deployed at address: 0x91Af1CD8Bbc3b7dCcd5fF19f522cd9A49067F928
    contract address:  0x91Af1CD8Bbc3b7dCcd5fF19f522cd9A49067F928
    ```

    \
    The deployment will include the transaction data as well as the address the contract was deployed to:

    ```bash
    Contract deployed at address: 0x91Af1CD8Bbc3b7dCcd5fF19f522cd9A49067F928
    ```

    \
    You can now view the contract on devnet explorer using the following convention:\
    `https://explorer-devnet.coti.io/address/<contract deployment address>` \
    \
    In our case: \
    [**https://explorer-devnet.coti.io/contract/0x91af1cd8bbc3b7dccd5ff19f522cd9a49067f928**](https://explorer-devnet.coti.io/contract/0x91af1cd8bbc3b7dccd5ff19f522cd9a49067f928)

Let's note the following facts about the contract and the script:

*   When the contract was deployed, the `uint64 private clearValue` variable was assigned a value of `5` as evidenced by [lines 15-17](https://github.com/coti-io/confidentiality-contracts/blob/main/contracts/examples/DataOnChain.sol#L15-L17) of the contract:&#x20;

    ```solidity
     constructor () {
            clearValue = 5;
        }
    ```
* The function [`getSomeValue`](https://github.com/coti-io/confidentiality-contracts/blob/main/contracts/examples/DataOnChain.sol#L67-L69) of the contract will then return the value of `clearValue`
* The function [`basic_get_value`](https://github.com/coti-io/coti-sdk-python-examples/blob/master/examples/data\_onchain/data\_on\_chain.py#L286-L290) of the python script is making sure the value was set as expected.

Now let's take a look on at the basic flow that sends a clear value, encrypts it, and decrypts it.

* The python function [`basic_clear_encrypt_decrypt`](https://github.com/coti-io/coti-sdk-python-examples/blob/master/examples/data\_onchain/data\_on\_chain.py#L172-L184) initiates the process, calling other functions as necessary.
* The python function [`save_clear_value_network_encrypted_in_contract`](https://github.com/coti-io/coti-sdk-python-examples/blob/master/examples/data\_onchain/data\_on\_chain.py#L229-L235) is used to pass a clear value from the user.&#x20;
* Once the value is populated, the script will call the Solidity contract and use its [`setSomeEncryptedValue`](https://github.com/coti-io/confidentiality-contracts/blob/main/contracts/examples/DataOnChain.sol#L41-L43) function. This function in turn calls `setPublic64` from the [`MpcCore`](https://github.com/coti-io/confidentiality-contracts/blob/main/contracts/lib/MpcCore.sol)  library, which turns the value into GarbledText and then into CipherText using the network key. This value is now encrypted in a network block.
* In order to validate the block had a ClearText input, the block details from the transaction are extracted using the [`validate_block_has_tx_input_encrypted_value`](https://github.com/coti-io/coti-sdk-python-examples/blob/master/examples/data\_onchain/data\_on\_chain.py#L253-L265) function.
* The value is then encrypted using the function [`save_network_encrypted_to_user_encrypted_input_in_contract`](https://github.com/coti-io/coti-sdk-python-examples/blob/master/examples/data\_onchain/data\_on\_chain.py#L303-L305)  , this function saves the network-encrypted value to the user-encrypted input in the contract.
* The encrypted value is retrieved from the contract using the function [`get_user_encrypted_from_contract`](https://github.com/coti-io/coti-sdk-python-examples/blob/master/examples/data\_onchain/data\_on\_chain.py#L268C5-L269) to ensure the encrypted value can be successfully retrieved with the user's AES key.

## ERC20

The following process will help you run the [**`erc20.ts`**](https://github.com/coti-io/coti-sdk-typescript-examples/blob/main/src/examples/erc20.ts) example from the [**COTI Typescript SDK Examples**](https://github.com/coti-io/coti-sdk-typescript-examples) project. The script includes functions for transferring tokens, approving allowances, and handling confidential transactions. The script uses various utilities from the SDK to manage confidential accounts, decrypt values, and ensure correct balances and allowances during transactions. It will also:

* Create a EOA (Externally Owned Account)
* Validate minimum balance

{% hint style="info" %}
Ensure your environment meets all the pre-requisites. Visit the [pre-requisites section of the readme](https://github.com/coti-io/coti-sdk-typescript-examples/blob/main/README.md).&#x20;
{% endhint %}

1.  Clone the Typescript examples repo along with its submodules into your desired location

    ```bash
    git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/coti-io/coti-sdk-typescript-examples.git
    ```


2.  Change directory to the newly create one

    ```bash
    cd coti-sdk-typescript-examples
    ```


3.  Install dependencies

    ```bash
    yarn
    ```


4.  Run `erc20.ts` script

    ```bash
    yarn erc20
    ```

    \
    Running this test will automatically create an account and a key/value pair with name: `SIGNING_KEY` (visible in the .env file). The script will output something like this:\


    ```bash
    yarn run v1.22.22
    $ ts-node src/main.ts erc20
    ************* Created new account  0x87c13D0f5903a68bE8288E52b23A220CeC6b1aB6  and saved into .env file *************

    Error: Please use faucet to fund account 0x87c13D0f5903a68bE8288E52b23A220CeC6b1aB6
    ```

    \
    It is normal to receive the exception `Error: Please use faucet to fund account` on the first run. This will be resolved once the account is funded. \

5. Head to the faucet at [**https://faucet.coti.io**](https://faucet.coti.io) to get devnet funds. \
   Send the following message to the BOT using your newly created account, visible in the fourth line of the response `Created new account  0x87c13D0f5903a68bE8288E52b23A220CeC6b1aB6 [...]`\
   \
   `devnet <account address>`\
   \
   The bot will reply with the message:\
   \
   `<username> faucet transferred 5 COTIv2 (devnet)` \
   &#x20;
6.  Run `erc20.ts` script once more

    ```bash
    yarn erc20
    ```

## ERC20Example

The following process will help you run the [**ERC20Example.sol**](https://github.com/coti-io/confidentiality-contracts/blob/main/contracts/examples/ERC20Example.sol) example from the [**COTI confidentiality-contracts**](https://github.com/coti-io/confidentiality-contracts) project. The contract defines a custom ERC20 token called `ERC20Example` that extends the functionality of the ConfidentialERC20 token. Additionally it will:

* Create a EOA (Externally Owned Account)
* Validate minimum balance

The contract is compiled and deployed with Hardhat using the [`confidential-erc20.test.ts`](https://github.com/coti-io/confidentiality-contracts/blob/main/test-hardhat/confidential-erc20.test.ts) test suite contained in the [`test-hardhat`](https://github.com/coti-io/confidentiality-contracts/tree/main/test-hardhat) directory of the project.

Running the test suite does the following:

* **Deploys the `ERC20Example` contract**: Sets up the token with specific details (name, symbol, initial supply).
* **Tests the deployment**: Verifies the contract address, initial balance, and token details (name, symbol, decimals, total supply).
* **Tests transfers**: Both clear and confidential transfers, including `transferFrom` functionality with and without prior allowance.
* **Tests approvals and allowances**: Ensures that the contract correctly handles approvals and allowances, both clear and confidential.
