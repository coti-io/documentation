# SDK Functions

The COTI SDKs provide several functions that allow for key management, signing, and managing inputs & outputs. These are currently available for the Python and Typescript SDKs, with more coming soon.

If you would like to see a particular feature built for an SDK or spot an issue, please drop us a note via a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/coti-io/confidentiality-contracts/issues).
