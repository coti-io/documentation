# ðŸš€ Quickstart

This quick start guide will help developers get started with deploying smart contracts onto the COTI network. If you are already familiar with Ethereum, EVM-related technologies, smart contracts and web3, follow the steps below to get started.

You should already be familiar with concepts such as **Ethereum**, **EVM**, and **Smart Contracts**.

If you are new to Ethereum and smart contracts, get familiar with these topics by following these introductory guides:

* [Introduction to Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/intro-to-ethereum/)
* [Introduction to Smart Contracts](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/smart-contracts/)
* [Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/evm/)

If you want to get familiar with COTI and the wider privacy topic, get started with the [**Introduction**](<README (1).md>) section.

## Native Transfer

The following process will help you deploy the [**`native_transfer.py`**](https://github.com/coti-io/coti-sdk-python/blob/main/examples/basics/native\_transfer.py) example from the [COTI Python SDK](https://github.com/coti-io/coti-sdk-python/tree/main). This script will transfer native funds from your wallet account to a random wallet. It will also:

* Create an account
* Create an EOA private key for execution
* Validate minimum balance

{% hint style="info" %}
Ensure your environment meets all the pre-requisites. Visit the [pre-requisites section of the readme](https://github.com/coti-io/coti-sdk-python/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#python-sdk-coti-sdk-python---usage).
{% endhint %}

1.  Clone the Python SDK along with its submodules into your desired location

    ```bash
    git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:coti-io/coti-sdk-python.git
    ```


2.  Change directory to the newly create one

    ```bash
    cd coti-sdk-python.git
    ```


3.  Install the project's requirements

    ```bash
    python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```


4.  Run the `native_transfer.py` script

    ```bash
    python3 examples/basics/native_transfer.py
    ```

    \
    Running the script will automatically create an account and an `ACCOUNT_PRIVATE_KEY` (visible in the `.env` file). The script output will look something like this:



    ```bash
    So you dont have an account yet, dont worry... lets create one right now!
    Creation done!

    ```

    \
    It is normal to receive the exception `Not enough balance!` on first run. This will be resolved once the account is funded.\

5. Head to the faucet at [**https://faucet.coti.io**](https://faucet.coti.io) to get devnet funds. Send the following message to the bot:\
   \
   `devnet <your_eoa_address>`\
   \
   The bot will reply with the message:\
   \
   `<username> faucet transferred 5 COTIv2 (devnet)` \

6.  Run the `native_transfer.py` script once more

    ```bash
    python3 examples/basics/native_transfer.py
    ```

    \
    The output will be as follows:

    ```bash

    ```

    \
    Now that your account is created and funded, we can now onboard the account to get our new network key.

## On-board Account

The following process will help you deploy the [**`onboard_account.py`**](https://github.com/coti-io/coti-sdk-python/blob/main/examples/onboard/onboard\_account.py) example from the [COTI Python SDK](https://github.com/coti-io/coti-sdk-python/tree/main). This script onboards an EOA into the network. It will also:

* Create an AES key unique for the user
* Use the AES key to encrypt all data sent back to the wallet

This is a mandatory script for any operation executed in a contract that requires encrypt/decrypt actions.

1.  Run the `onboard_account.py` script

    ```bash
    python3 examples/onboard/onboard_account.py
    ```

    \
    Running the script will automatically create an account and an `ACCOUNT_PRIVATE_KEY` (visible in the `.env` file). The script output will look something like this:

    ```bash
    /Users/user/projects/coti-sdk-python/venv/bin/python /Users/user/projects/coti-sdk-python/examples/basics/native_transfer.py

    Process finished with exit code 0
