# ðŸš€ Quickstart

This quick start guide will help developers get started with deploying smart contracts onto the COTI network. If you are already familiar with Ethereum, EVM-related technologies, smart contracts and web3, follow the steps below to get started.

You should already be familiar with concepts such as **Ethereum**, **EVM**, and **Smart Contracts**.

If you are new to Ethereum and smart contracts, the following introductory guides are a great place to get started:

* [Introduction to Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/intro-to-ethereum/)
* [Introduction to Smart Contracts](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/smart-contracts/)
* [Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/evm/)

{% endhint %}

If you'd like to learn more about V1 to V2 transformation, read [COTI's evolution from V1 to V2](https://medium.com/cotinetwork/how-coti-is-gearing-up-for-2024-and-beyond-e0d465794767#6e09); To get familiar with some of the core concepts of blockchain privacy, get started with the [**Introduction**](<README (1).md>) section.

## Network Info

You can view COTI network information on the [networks.md](networks.md "mention") page, Also to add it to the networks of your wallet application you can use one the following sites:

* [https://chainlist.org](https://chainlist.org)
* [https://chainlist.wtf](https://chainlist.wtf)
* [https://explorer-devnet.coti.io](https://explorer-devnet.coti.io) (Add to Metamask option)

## Native Transfer

The following process will help you deploy the [**`native_transfer.py`**](https://github.com/coti-io/coti-sdk-python/blob/main/examples/basics/native\_transfer.py) example from the [COTI Python SDK](https://github.com/coti-io/coti-sdk-python/tree/main). This script will transfer native funds from your wallet account to a random wallet. It will also:

* Create a EOA (External Owner Account)
* Validate minimum balance

{% hint style="info" %}
Ensure your environment meets all the pre-requisites. Visit the [pre-requisites section of the readme](https://github.com/coti-io/coti-sdk-python/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#python-sdk-coti-sdk-python---usage). Alternatively, use an editor like [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/) that can take care of the pre-requisites for you.
{% endhint %}

1.  Clone the Python SDK along with its submodules into your desired location

    ```bash
    git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:coti-io/coti-sdk-python-examples.git
    ```


2.  Change directory to the newly create one

    ```bash
    cd coti-sdk-python-examples
    ```


3.  Install the project's requirements

    ```bash
    python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```


4.  Set the python path as following

    ```bash
    export PYTHONPATH=$PWD
    ```
5.  Run the `native_transfer.py` script

    ```bash
    python3 examples/basics/native_transfer.py
    ```

    \
    Running the script will automatically create an account and a key/value pair with name: `ACCOUNT_PRIVATE_KEY` (visible in the `.env` file). The script will output something like this:



    ```bash
    So you dont have an account yet, dont worry... lets create one right now!
    Creation done!

    ```

    \
    It is normal to receive the exception `Not enough balance!` on the first run. This will be resolved once the account is funded.\

6. Head to the faucet at [**https://faucet.coti.io**](https://faucet.coti.io) to get devnet funds. \
   Send the following message to the BOT using your newly created `account address`:\
   \
   `devnet <account address>`\
   \
   The bot will reply with the message:\
   \
   `<username> faucet transferred 5 COTIv2 (devnet)` \

7.  Run the `native_transfer.py` script once more

    ```bash
    python3 examples/basics/native_transfer.py
    ```

    \
    The script will output as following:

    ```bash

    ```

    \
    Now that your account is created and funded, you can now onboard the account to get your new network key.

## On-board Account

The following process will help you deploy the [**`onboard_account.py`**](https://github.com/coti-io/coti-sdk-python/blob/main/examples/onboard/onboard\_account.py) example from the [COTI Python SDK Examples](https://github.com/coti-io/coti-sdk-python-examples). This script onboards an EOA into the network. It will also:

* Trigger the network to create an AES key unique for the user
* Encrypt the unique user AES key using Public key so that its value can be viewed only by the EOA owner

This is a mandatory script for any operation executed in any contract that requires encrypt/decrypt that are part of the new EVM precompiles actions.

1.  Run the `onboard_account.py` script

    <pre class="language-bash"><code class="lang-bash"><strong>python3 examples/onboard/onboard_account.py
    </strong></code></pre>

    \
    Running the script will automatically create an account and an `ACCOUNT_ENCRYPTION_KEY` (visible in the `.env` file as well as the output). The script output will look something like this:\


    ```bash
    provider:  https://devnet.coti.io

    (True, 'ACCOUNT_ENCRYPTION_KEY', 'fd3d781ddcbd1e1cedd2d75460f30636')
    ```



    {% hint style="info" %}
    This encryption key is **sensitive.** Ensure it is not uploaded to public places and keep it safe. This key is prodiced per EOA wallet, meaning a unique wallet/EOA will have a unique encryption key.
    {% endhint %}

    \
    The `.env` file will also have other useful information, such as the node address, websocket address, and the contract directories.\
    \
    Now that the account is onboarded, let's deploy a contract on-chain.

## Deploy Data On-Chain

The following process will help you deploy the [**`DataOnChain.sol`**](https://github.com/coti-io/confidentiality-contracts/blob/main/contracts/examples/DataOnChain.sol) example from the [**confidentiality-contracts**](https://github.com/coti-io/confidentiality-contracts/) repository, which is imported as a git submodule in the Python SDK Examples.&#x20;

This contract can be used in order to browse and get a feel of the COTI network. The contract allows for the secure handling of encrypted data, enabling storage, transformation, and arithmetic operations on encrypted values using the `MpcCore` library. It supports operations where values are encrypted using both network and user keys, ensuring data privacy and security on-chain.

This contract should be run at the root of `confidentiality-contracts` directory. If using an editor, set it as your working directory.\
\
We will use Hardhat to showcase how to compile and deploy the contract to the COTI network.

1.  Navigate to the `examples` directory in the `confidentiality-contracts` directory inside the `coti-sdk-python` project.

    ```bash
    cd confidentiality-contracts/contracts/examples
    ```


2.  Install Hardhat and dependencies locally

    ```bash
    npm install --save-dev hardhat @nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox ethers dotenv
    ```


3.  Add a Hardhat task to compile the contract: to compile the specific contract we'll need to make use of a custom task, as Hardhat does not support direct modification of the `solidity` configuration for compiling specific contracts. Update the Hardhat config file`hardhat.config.ts` to add the task as follows:\


    ```typescript
    import { HardhatUserConfig } from "hardhat/config"
    import { task } from "hardhat/config";
    import "@nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox"
    import dotenv from "dotenv"
    dotenv.config()

    // Define a new task called "compileDataOnChain"
    task("compileDataOnChain", "Compiles only DataOnChain.sol", async (_, hre) => {
      await hre.run("compile", {
        paths: ["contracts/DataOnChain.sol"]
      });
    });

    const config: HardhatUserConfig = {
      defaultNetwork: "devnet",
      solidity: "0.8.24",
      networks: {
        // hardhat: {},
        devnet: {
          url: "https://devnet.coti.io",
          chainId: 13068200,
        },
      },
      paths:{
        tests:'test-hardhat',
      }
    }

    export default config
    ```


4.  Compile the `DataOnChain.sol` contract

    ```bash
    npx hardhat compileDataOnChain
    ```


5.  Deploy the `DataOnChain.sol` contract: in order to deploy the contract, we'll create a simple deployment script. The script should be placed under the `scripts` folder of your project. In our particular case, we'll create under the `confidentiality-contracts` directory. If you don't have a `scripts` directory, you can create one. Then create a file inside the directory, we'll call it **`deploy_dataonchain.js`**. The contents of the file as follows:\


    ```javascript
    const { ethers } = require("hardhat");

    async function main() {
      // Log the account being used to deploy
      const [deployer] = await ethers.getSigners();
      console.log("Deploying contracts with the account:", deployer.address);

      // Get the Contract Factory
      const DataOnChain = await ethers.getContractFactory("DataOnChain");

      // Deploy the contract and get the deployment transaction
      const deployTx = await DataOnChain.getDeployTransaction(/* constructor arguments, if any */);
      console.log("Deployment transaction:", deployTx);

      // Send the deployment transaction
      const sentTx = await deployer.sendTransaction(deployTx);
      console.log("Sent transaction:", sentTx);

      // Wait for the contract deployment transaction to be mined
      const receipt = await sentTx.wait();
      console.log("Transaction receipt:", receipt);

      // Log the contract address
      const contractAddress = receipt.contractAddress;
      console.log("DataOnChain deployed to:", contractAddress);
    }

    main().catch((error) => {
      console.error(error);
      process.exit(1);
    });
    ```

    \
    Save the file.\

6.  Change directory to `confidentiality-contracts` and run the deployment script:

    ```bash
    node scripts/deploy_dataonchain.js
    ```


7.  The deployment will include the transaction data as well as the address the contract was deployed to:

    ```bash
    DataOnChain deployed to: 0x9cDFC135967cd16E2b6A1cE60f1748013096B97e
    ```

    \
    You can now view the contract on devnet explorer using the following convention:\
    `https://explorer-devnet.coti.io/address/<contract deployment address>` \
    \
    In our case:\
    [**https://explorer-devnet.coti.io/address/0x9cdfc135967cd16e2b6a1ce60f1748013096b97e**](https://explorer-devnet.coti.io/address/0x9cdfc135967cd16e2b6a1ce60f1748013096b97e?tab=transactions)
