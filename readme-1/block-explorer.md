# Block Explorer

The COTI blockchain explorer is a tool that allows you to search and view information on the COTI gcEVM blockchain. It's like a search engine for blockchain data. You can use it to:

1. Look up transactions: See details about specific transactions, such as sender and receiver addresses and transaction status.
2. Check balances: View the balance of a particular cryptocurrency address.
3. Explore blocks: See information about blocks, such as their size, time of creation, and included transactions.
4. Add the COTI network to your EOA wallet (i.e., MetaMask)
