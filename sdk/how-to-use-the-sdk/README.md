# ðŸ¥¸ How to Use the SDK

Before delving into the examples showcasing the functionalities of our SDK across Golang, Python, and JavaScript, it's crucial to understand the foundational it offers. With Soda Labs SDK, developers gain access to essential encryption schemes such as AES and RSA, enabling secure data transmission and storage. Our SDK also supports ECDSA signature schemes, ensuring the integrity and authenticity of transactions. Additionally, we provide seamless integration with the Soda Labs interface, offering convenient methods for signing, verifying, and preparing input text, along with generating function signatures. Whether you're encrypting sensitive data, verifying signatures, or interacting with the Soda Labs interface, our SDK equips you with the tools necessary to build robust and secure applications across multiple programming languages. The following examples demonstrate how to use the SDK.
